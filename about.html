                <div id="about-me">
                    <p>I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Software Engineering at DePaul University in Chicago, IL. In my free time, I work on improving my development skills by teaching myself how to code in Python, HTML/CSS, and R, among other languages.</p>

                    <p>I graduated in May, 2016 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with my degree in Bioengineering. After working on my <a href="sendesign-project.html">Senior Design project</a> during my final year (which involved a ton of coding), I decided to follow my passion for software development and programming.</p>

                    <p>You can <a href="mailto:mhismail3@gmail.com" target="_blank">send me an email</a> if you would like to get in touch.</p>

                    <p>Feel free to take a look at my blog to find out more about some of the things that interest me. Or, keep scrolling to see a more formal list of my previous accomplishments, including some of the things that I was involved with as a Bioengineer. </p>

                        <h4>Senior Design Project - Aug 2015 to May 2016</h4>
                        <p>I worked under the guidance of the Bretl Research Group to improve the functionality and sensory feedback of a prosthetic arm through iterative design and extensive experimentation.</p>

                        <p>We implemented barometric pressure sensors into fingertips in order to measure force during interactions, and conveyed corresponding information to the user through electrotactile stimulation via electrodes attached on the upper arm.</p>

                        <p>Our project won two awards: <b>Best Senior Design Presentation - Judges' Choice</b> and <b>Best Senior Design Vendor Display.</b></p>


                        <h4>Student Consultant at EntreCORPS Consulting - Sep 2015 to May 2016</h4>
                        <p>I performed in-depth market research and financial analysis within teams of 6 consultants in order to assess the viability of current strategies and market plans for over 10 clients per semester.</p> 
                        <p>As a team we identified related product information and constructed creative, go-to market strategies for new ventures and startups to access new or existing markets. By designing financial business models, we worked to identify target areas to enhance product stability and increase long-term profitability.</p>


                        <h4>Digital Marketing Intern at Art Spot Chicago - June 2015 to Nov 2015</h4>

                        <p>I assessed and created digital marketing strategies to grow and maintain a strong social media presence, optimize ROI and drive revenue growth for existing products and services.</p>

                        <h4>Research Intern at Lu Resarch Lab - May 2014 to October 2014</h4>
                        <p>I performed over 15 experiments transfecting DNA plasmids into bacterial cultures from various strains in order to gauge production of certain genes for further use as a cancer protein inhibitor.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I prepared multiple stock solutions of varying chemical makeup and concentrations for future use in various experiments.</p>
