            <h2>Hey there.</h2>
            
            <p>I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Cybersecurity at DePaul University in Chicago, IL. In my free time, I work on improving my development skills by teaching myself how to code in Python, HTML/CSS, and R, among other languages.</p>

            <p>I graduated in May, 2016 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with my degree in Bioengineering. After working on my Senior Design project during my final year, I decided to switch career paths to what I believe is an incredibly important and useful field to be a part of.</p>

            <p>Feel free to take a look at my blog to find out more about some of the things that interest me. </p>
