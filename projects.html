                <p>I'm currently enrolled in Coursera's Data Science Specialization, a series of online courses designed by Johns Hopkins University to cover many concepts and tools involved in data science. This is a collection of programs that I've written using RStudio involving techniques and skills learned in these courses, designed to solve many common types of problems. </p>

                <p>For my undergraduate Senior Design Project, my team and I designed a low-cost sensory feedback system, implemented into a 3D-printed myoelectric prosthetic hand. We added barometric pressure sensors into the fingertips and proximal finger regions in order to measure forces applied to and by the prosthetic hand. Force information is conveyed to the user through electrotactile stimulation via electrodes located on the upper arm. The magnitude of stimulation felt by the user is proportional to the reading from the corresponding pressure sensor.</p>
